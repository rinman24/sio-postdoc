Much of the Arctic is moderated by the ocean water,
which can never have a temperature below -2 C (28 F).
In the winter, this relatively warm water keeps the
North Pole from being the coldest place in the Northern
Hemisphere, and it is also part of the reason that
Antartica is co much older than the Arctic.
